				<h1>Pison FFT Classifier</h1>
				<p> My first project at Pison. The FFT Classifier was an idea brought up by the CTO to
				better classify activations from the Pison device. To read more about activations and the Pison device
				check out the Pison section in the work tab. The plotter started as a way to visualize the signal from 
				the Pison device but as my time at Pison went on we continued to add new features to it. First there was 
				the box classifier. The box classifier allowed users to draw a box in the plot window (top image) and if
				any points in the signal landed in the box it would be considered an activation. In addition to this we 
				added the ability to view different filters over the signal simultaneously in multiple plots contained in
				one window (top image). Eventually we moved from boxes to sliders to classify the signal because sliders
				were easier to use accurately on smart phones (bottom image). This whole process was a great way to learn
				the importance of extensibility while programming. It was clear how some decisions I had made while designing
				a previous feature made it easier to implement new features and how other decisions made it much more difficult.
				I was the main developer on this project. </p>

				<h1>Pison Nasa Demo</h1>
				<p>A grant I was assigned to work on at Pison. Nasa was interested in using the Pison device for 
				astronauts. The idea was to make it easier for astronauts to fix something if anything went wrong
				on a spaceship. They would have the instructions built into their helmet and they would navigate through
				them using the Pison device. This way their hands are free to hold tools or anything else needed to perform the
				task at hand. The program was made in Unity and ran on augmented reality glasses. What our demo did was navigate
				through a pdf using gestures from the device. The processs of creating the interface involved creating a basic
				layout based on what we thought would work best and then we would have people who worked at NASA come in and give
				us feedback on how to improve the experience. The end goal was to have people come in and build something using
				instructions from the interface and then a regular instruction booklet and see if they could perform tasks
				more easily/faster with our device. The user testing happened after I left Pison to go back to school. I was one
				of the two developers working on this project. </p>

				<h1>Pison Space Force</h1>
				<p>A hackathon project I made while at Pison. The game was made in Unity
				and it uses the Pison device as a controller. Your hand mimics the movement of
				the spaceship and you lift your finger to shoot. A simple game but it's cool to
				control a spaceship with basically just your hand.</p>
