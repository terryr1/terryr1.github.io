				<h1>Chai</h1>
				<p> A project I worked on during the pandemic. Mental health was a major topic at the time largely due to 
					the lack of social interaction. I wanted to create a space for people to have meaningful conversations about their
					life experiences. </p>
					
					<p> 
						I eventually had to bring the app down due to less free time after starting a full time job and the difficulty in maintaining a social app as it scales up.

				<h1>Pison Nasa Demo</h1>
<p></p>

				<p>A grant project I worked on at Pison. NASA expressed interest in utilizing the Pison device for astronauts. 
					The goal was to simplify troubleshooting procedures during space missions. 
					We could do this by integrating instructions into astronauts' helmets, allowing them to navigate with the Pison device and leaving their hands free for tools and tasks.
					 The program was developed in Unity and ran on augmented reality glasses.
					Our demo demonstrated gesture-based navigation through PDF documents.
					 We designed the interface layout and received feedback from NASA personnel to enhance the user experience. 
					 The project aimed to compare task performance using our interface versus traditional instruction booklets. </p>
