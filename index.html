		<h1> About Me </h1>
		<p> I'm Terry Roy, a software developer and undergraduate student at Northeastern University. I'm a computer scientist because I love to create. I believe software development is all about creativity. Create whatever you want and share it instantly with people all over the world to use. My goal is to create programs that look beautiful and work flawlessly. My favorite hobbies are playing the guitar, drawing, and playing any sport you can name. I'm also a part of the service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega at Northeastern and compete on the Club Spikeball team at Northeastern. </p>
